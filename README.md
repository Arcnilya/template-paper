# A LaTeX template for an IEEEish paper
I have created a [main.tex](main.tex) file with packages and new commands which are handy.
I have also split the section into separate .tex files within [src](src) together with [ref.bib](src/ref.bib).
- Compile the pdf with `pdflatex main.tex`
- Rebresh references with `bibtex main`.
